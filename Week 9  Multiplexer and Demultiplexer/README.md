## Lab Questions
In this lab we learned how to apply a multiplexer and demultiplexer to create a communications network between 
2 sources. By taking in a 4 bit input from one of 4 ports of the multiplexer we can then connect it to a receiving
output of a multiplexer by use of buttons. We can define where the information will go by using a 2 bit selector using
2 buttons.

### In plain English describe the function and use of a multiplexer.
The mux takes multiple inputs, and restricts the output to the value of only one of the inputs using selectors bits

### In plain English describe the function and use of a demultiplexer.
The demux takes one input, and channels it to one of multiple outputs depending on a selector bit

### What other uses might these circuits have? (Think Shannonâ€™s)
This circuit can be used to simplify more complex functions using shannon's expansion
